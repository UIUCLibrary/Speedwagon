======

This directory containers everything for testing out the jenkinsfile pipeline.

To use build and run the Dockerfile from the root of this source repository.

To add additional build nodes, add configuration files in yaml format to the
casc directory. For more information on this check the Jenkins Configuration
as Code documentation.

Note:

    * At the time of this writing (9/24/2020), jenkinsfile-runner has not hit
      version 1 and thus, this method is considered to be EXPERIMENTAL.

    * The Jenkinsfile used for this project uses docker agents to isolate tests
      on so you'll need to mount the docker socket when running.

      Such as the following.

        -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
