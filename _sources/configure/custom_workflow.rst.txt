Setting up customized workflow
==============================

A customized workflow simplifies the files packaging process.  An institution
can tailor a workflow to address specific packaging needs, selecting specific
tools for a given workflow. See the "Workflows and Glossary of Tools" to find
out what each tool does. Then follow the steps below to combine the tools
needed for a specific workflow.

#. Go to System
#. Go to tabs and select "New Tab" and name your workflow
#. On the left side select the tools for the workflow and select the "Add
   Item" to add it the tool on the right.
#. If you add the wrong tool, select it on right and click "Remove Item"
