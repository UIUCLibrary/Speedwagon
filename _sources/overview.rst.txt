Speedwagon is a file packaging and conversion tool developed by and used at
the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Library for preparing digitized
books for ingest into digital collections platforms like the HathiTrust
Digital Library, as well as systems like `Medusa
<https://medusa.library.illinois.edu/>`_ for digital preservation and the
locally run and managed
`Digital Collections <https://digital.library.illinois.edu/>`_.
Speedwagon is used to expedite the packaging of locally and vendor based
digitized content. It automates and streamlines quality assurance processes
to ensure package completeness and facilitate submission. Many of the tools
in Speedwagon may be useful to other institutions, but some of them are
specific to University of Illinois' digitization workflows.

This guide demonstrates how the U of I utilizes Speedwagon for packaging
locally as well as vendor-produced content, with some pointers on how other
institutions may adopt it by creating and customizing a file packaging
workflow based on institution-specific needs.  A glossary of the tools is
included in the guide to help new users identify what tools will work best
for them.  This guide will outline those workflows and provide visual
examples of package and directory structures.
