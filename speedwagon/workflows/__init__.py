r"""Subpackage:  Contains the bundled workflows in Speedwagon.

During startup, this package is scanned for python modules that start with
"workflow\\_" in the filename. These files are then scanned to see if they
contain for any classes which implements speedwagon.job.AbsWorkflow base
class. As these classes are located, they made available to Speedwagon.

Example:
    The CompletenessWorkflow() class in the file,
    speedwagon/workflows/workflow_completeness.py will be made available as
    "Verify HathiTrust Package Completeness". However, the class in the same
    file, ValidateOCRFilesTask() implements Subtask instead, so it will not be.
