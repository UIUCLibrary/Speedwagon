#. Internal Digitization Lab Workflow

    Determine the package profile created by the lab and what files are
    generated.  Refer to the section called "Workflow Diagram and Directory
    Structure" to determine the package profile you should use.

    Depending on an institution’s workflow, various combinations of
    Speedwagon tools are possible.  A customized workflow tab is suggested to
    streamline the process, combining the tools for an institution’s workflow.

    Additional tools are available to aid packaging and file creation for
