Installation
============

There are a number of ways to install Speedwagon, depending on your needs.

Installation on Windows
-----------------------

Since the majority of computer workstations used by the staff of The University
of Illinois at Urbana Champaign libraries run the Windows operating system,
the development of Speedwagon focused on making the application easily
accessible on the Windows platform. A great deal work has gone into making
Speedwagon not only easy to use but also easy to install on Windows for an
average user.

Installation on Windows from MSI installer
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Normal Windows users can download and install a prebuilt Windows Installer
.msi file. Unless you have experience with installing Python packages, you
should use this method because it is the easiest. This installer uses the
standard windows install wizard to help you install everything needed
to run Speedwagon. In addition, the install wizard creates a start menu icon
and adds an easy way to uninstall it later if you choose.

Double click on the Speedwagon-version.number.msi file to start the
installation wizard.

Installation on Windows from whl File
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If you do not want to install the msi but you still want to install a prebuilt
package, you can install the Python wheel.

Install Speedwagon whl file from the command line::

    python -m pip install D:\hborcher\Downloads\speedwagon-0.1.4b5-py3-none-any.whl

Installation on Windows from Source
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If you do not want to install the msi or the whl file.


#. Download the latest `source release from github
   <https://github.com/UIUCLibrary/Speedwagon/releases>`_.

#. Install Speedwagon as a Python package from the command line::

    python setup.py install

Installation on Other Operating Systems
---------------------------------------

The majority of the code in Speedwagon is operating system agnostic. However,
because of the resources available and the internal demand for Windows
installers, Speedwagon has been mainly developed and tested to work on Windows.
With this said, Speedwagon can run on a Mac computer. However, it requires
more work from the user and running it on a Mac has caveats. Not every feature
is available and there are currently no plans to support prebuilt standalone
distributions.
